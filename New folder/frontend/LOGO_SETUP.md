# Adding the Logo Image

To complete the logo setup:

1. **Save the logo image** (Vipanchi Cakes & Bites logo) as `logo.png` in:
   ```
   src/assets/logo.png
   ```

2. The Angular app is now styled with the maroon/burgundy (#5c2e2e) and gold (#d4a574) color scheme from the logo.

3. Once you place the `logo.png` file in the assets folder, the logo will appear in the header when you run the app.

## Color Scheme Applied

- **Primary (Maroon/Burgundy)**: #5c2e2e
- **Secondary (Gold)**: #d4a574
- **Accent (Sienna)**: #8b4513
- **Background**: Warm cream/beige gradient

The entire admin interface now matches the elegant and professional branding of Vipanchi Cakes & Bites!
